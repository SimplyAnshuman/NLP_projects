    "can be defined and the valid ways that they can be used can be precisely defined. We cannot do\n",
    "this with natural language. Natural languages are not designed; they emerge, and therefore\n",
    "there is no formal specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be formal rules and heuristics for parts of the language, but as soon as rules\n",
    "are defined, you will devise or encounter counter examples that contradict the rules. Natural\n",
    "languages involve vast numbers of terms that can be used in ways that introduce all kinds of\n",
    "ambiguities, yet can still be understood by other humans. Further, languages change, word usages change: it is a moving target. Nevertheless, linguists try to specify the language with\n",
    "formal grammars and structures. It can be done, but it is very difficult and the results can\n",
    "be fragile. An alternative approach to specifying the model of the language is to learn it from\n",

    "can be made and learned for each input sequence. Similarly, when making predictions, the\n",
    "process can be seeded with one or a few words, then predicted words can be gathered and\n",
    "presented as input on subsequent predictions in order to build up a generated output sequence\n",
    "Therefore, each model will involve splitting the source text into input and output sequences,\n",
    "such that the model can learn to predict words. There are many ways to frame thesequences\n",
    "from a source text for language modeling. In this tutorial, we will explore 3 different ways of\n",
